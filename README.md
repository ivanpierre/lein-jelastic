# lein-jelastic

A Leiningen plugin for [Jelastic][1].

## Configuration

To use lein-jelastic, you have to add following configuration to your
`project.clj` file.

```clojure
:plugins [[lein-jelastic "0.1.0"]]

:jelastic {:apihoster "app.jelastic.provider.com"
           :email "your@mail.com"
           :password "XXXXXXXX" 
           :environment "myapp"
           ; Optional context
           ; :context "mycontext"
           }
```

As storing user and password information in the project directly is generally not
so good idea, you can store sensitive information on your `~/.lein/profiles.clj` file.

```clojure
{:user {:jelastic {:email "your@email.com" :password "XXXXXXX"}}}
```
